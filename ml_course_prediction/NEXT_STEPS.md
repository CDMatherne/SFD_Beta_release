# Next Steps - ML Course Prediction Development

## Current Status ✅
- **14,265 trajectories** successfully created
- Data pipeline working correctly
- Trajectory segmentation and filtering operational

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Verify Sequence Creation and Quality
Run the analysis script to check:
- How many training sequences are created from the 14,265 trajectories
- Sequence quality (input length, target horizon, feature completeness)
- Data distribution across vessel types

**Command:**
```bash
python LLM-MLv1/ml_course_prediction/training/analyze_sequences.py
```

**What to look for:**
- Number of sequences created (should be many more than trajectories due to sliding windows)
- Average input points per sequence
- Prediction horizon distribution (should be around 48 hours)
- Feature completeness (SOG, COG availability)

### 2. Model Architecture Implementation (Phase 2)

Once sequences are verified, implement the hybrid LSTM-Transformer model:

#### 2.1 Create Model Architecture
- **File**: `models/architectures/hybrid_model.py`
- **Components**:
  - LSTM layers for short-term temporal patterns
  - Transformer encoder for long-term dependencies
  - Attention mechanism
  - Output layers with uncertainty quantification
  - Physics-informed constraints

#### 2.2 Key Model Features
- **Input**: Sequence features (position, speed, course, temporal, vessel characteristics)
- **Output**: 
  - Predicted positions (LAT, LON) at 48-hour horizon
  - Speed (SOG) and Course (COG) predictions
  - Uncertainty estimates (1σ confidence intervals)
- **Architecture**: 
  - LSTM: 2-3 layers, 128-256 hidden units
  - Transformer: 4-6 encoder layers, 8 attention heads
  - Output: Dense layers with uncertainty heads

### 3. Training Infrastructure (Phase 3)

#### 3.1 Training Loop
- **File**: `training/trainer.py`
- **Features**:
  - Data loading and batching
  - Multi-objective loss function
  - Uncertainty calibration
  - Checkpointing and logging
  - Early stopping

#### 3.2 Loss Function
- Position loss (MSE on LAT/LON)
- Speed/Course loss
- Uncertainty calibration loss
- Physics constraint penalties

#### 3.3 Training Configuration
- Batch size: 32-64
- Learning rate: 1e-4 with decay
- Epochs: 50-100
- Validation split: 15%
- Test split: 15%

### 4. Evaluation and Validation (Phase 4)

#### 4.1 Metrics
- Position error (MAE, RMSE in nautical miles)
- Uncertainty coverage (68% confidence interval)
- Temporal accuracy
- Speed/Course error

#### 4.2 Validation
- Test on held-out data
- Cross-validation by vessel type
- Anomaly detection capability testing

### 5. Prediction Interface (Phase 5)

#### 5.1 Inference API
- **File**: `inference/predictor.py`
- Real-time prediction from last known position
- Uncertainty quantification
- Anomaly scoring

#### 5.2 Integration
- API endpoints for law enforcement use
- Batch prediction for historical analysis
- Real-time streaming support

## Recommended Order

1. **Now**: Run `analyze_sequences.py` to verify sequence quality
2. **Next**: Implement model architecture (`models/architectures/hybrid_model.py`)
3. **Then**: Create training infrastructure (`training/trainer.py`)
4. **After**: Train initial model and evaluate
5. **Finally**: Build prediction interface

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Model Framework**: PyTorch or TensorFlow? (Recommend PyTorch for flexibility)
2. **Uncertainty Method**: Variational inference, Monte Carlo dropout, or ensemble?
3. **Training Data Scope**: Full year or subset for initial training?
4. **Hardware**: GPU available for training?
