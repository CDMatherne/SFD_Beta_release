# Update Summary: AIS 3-Hour Reporting Interval

## Changes Made

All project files have been updated to account for **AIS reports every 3 hours**, meaning:
- **Maximum 8 points per 24-hour window** (24 ÷ 3 = 8)
- **Minimum 2 points for valid sequence** (6 hours of data)

## Files Updated

### 1. `training/data_loader.py`
- **`min_points_in_24h`**: Changed from 3 to **2 points**
- Added constants: `AIS_REPORTING_INTERVAL_HOURS = 3.0`, `MAX_POINTS_PER_24H = 8`
- Updated comments to reflect 3-hour reporting interval
- **`min_trajectory_points`**: Changed from 3 to **2 points** in TrajectoryProcessor initialization

### 2. `utils/trajectory_utils.py`
- **`min_trajectory_points`**: Changed default from 3 to **2 points**
- Updated docstring to note: "AIS reports every 3 hours, so max 8 points per 24h window"
- Updated comment: "AIS reports every 3h, so min 2 points = 6h"

### 3. `utils/feature_engineering.py`
- Updated `create_sequence_features()` docstring
- Added note: "AIS reports come every 3 hours, so a 24-hour window contains at most 8 points"
- Updated comments to reflect 2-8 points expected per sequence

### 4. `models/configs/default_config.yaml`
- Updated `sequence_length` comment: "max 8 points: AIS reports every 3 hours"
- **`min_trajectory_length`**: Changed from 3 to **2**
- Added new config parameters:
  - `ais_reporting_interval_hours: 3.0`
  - `max_points_per_24h: 8`
- Updated `max_gap_hours` comment: "normal gap = 2 reporting intervals"

### 5. Documentation
- Created `AIS_REPORTING_INTERVAL.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Created `UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Key Parameter Changes

| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `min_trajectory_points` | 3 | **2** | 2 points = 6 hours (minimum reasonable) |
| `min_points_in_24h` | 3 | **2** | 2 points = 6 hours in 24h window |
| `max_points_per_24h` | N/A | **8** | 24h ÷ 3h = 8 points maximum |
| `ais_reporting_interval_hours` | N/A | **3.0** | AIS reports every 3 hours |

## Impact on Model Development

### Sequence Characteristics
- **Input sequences**: 2-8 points per 24-hour window
- **Variable length**: Sequences will have different numbers of points
- **Sparse temporal data**: Not every hour has a report

### Model Architecture Considerations
1. **Variable-length sequences**: Model must handle 2-8 points per input
2. **Padding strategy**: May need to pad shorter sequences or use variable-length architecture
3. **Feature extraction**: Must work with sparse temporal data
4. **Batch processing**: Consider variable-length batching or padding

### Training Data
- More sequences will pass validation (lowered from 3 to 2 points minimum)
- Sequences will have realistic point counts (2-8, not 24)
- Better alignment with actual AIS reporting patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Model Architecture**: Design to handle variable-length sequences (2-8 points)
2. **Padding/Interpolation**: Decide on strategy for shorter sequences
3. **Feature Engineering**: Ensure features work with sparse data
4. **Testing**: Verify sequences are created correctly with new parameters

## Validation

To verify the changes:
```bash
python LLM-MLv1/ml_course_prediction/training/analyze_sequences.py
```

Check that:
- Sequences have 2-8 points per 24-hour window
- More sequences are created (lower threshold)
- No warnings about "too short" trajectories with 2-8 points
